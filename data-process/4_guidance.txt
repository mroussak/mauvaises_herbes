  - Process : 
    - If we see an humain in a range of x Meter, stop the machine.
  - Output :
    - Boolean Stop

- Detect anomaly
  - Entry :
    - Detected Machine Part state (action)
    - Detected Machine Part suppose action
  - Process : 
    - If we see part that is not acting according to supposed action, stop considering that parts
    - We need to adjust tolerance 
  - Output : 
    - Condemn machine parts

- Find optimal path for tractor
  - Entry :  
    - Fields Limit absolute Coordinates from satelite
